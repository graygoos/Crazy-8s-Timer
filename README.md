# Crazy 8's Timer App for UX Design Sprints

Crazy-8s is a design sprint technique used in User Experience design. The idea is to block out eight minutes of time to sketch eight ideas, a minute for each idea. This Crazy-8s timer was developed to facilitate Crazy-8â€™s sessions. It beeps every 60 seconds for eight minutes, letting the user know when to move to the next sketch/idea. At the eighth minute the timer beeps three times to let the user know the session has ended.
